# Ragnarok Online Boss Tracker
> www.robt.herokuapp.com
> Kill, track, party!

This app was made to track boss kills over time in Ragnarok Online. Any anonymous user could create an account just by visiting their own custom route (robt.herokuapp.com/my-cool-timer). Unfortunately post heroku's free tier being deprecated the hosting has been taken down. This repository now lives as a history piece.
